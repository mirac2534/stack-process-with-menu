# stack-process-with-menu
I have done for you to study for stack process.
In this project, I used 8 function. They are menu, createStack, destroy_Stack, is_full, is_empty, pop, push, and peek functions.
menu function is for you can choose process.
createStack function is for you to make a choice.
destroy_Stack function is for releasing stack from memory.
is_full function is for checking whether the stack is full or not.
is_empty function is for checking whether the stack is empty or not.
pop function is for you to get the element out of the stack.
push function is for you to add element to the stack.
peek function is for you to show the last element.
I hope you understand stack process.
