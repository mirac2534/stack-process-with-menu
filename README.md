# Project Name: Stack Process with Menu

Date: 05.08.2024  
I have done for you to study for stack process. In this project, I used 8 function. They are menu, createStack, destroy_Stack, is_full, is_empty, pop, push, and peek functions.


## Planning

### 1. menu Function

### 2. createStack Function
- createStack function is for making a new stack. It created to allocate space in memory with malloc. After that, assigns the capacity to fixed capacity and the number of elements to zero.

### 3. destroy_Stack Function
- In the last process, program releases stack from memory.

### 4. is_full Function
- checks whether the stack is full or not.

### 5. is_empty Function
- checks whether the stack is empty or not.

### 6. pop Function
- We'll get the element out of the stack. Firstly, checks  stack is empty or not. 
- If stack is empty, returns false.
- If stack is not empty, exits element you entered. After that, stack size decreases. If it is success, returns true.
### 7. push Function
- We add elemets to the stack. Firstly, checks stack is full or not.
- If stack is full, returns false.
- If stack is not full, adds the element you entered to the stack. After that, stack size increases. If it is success, returns true.

### 8. peek Function
- Shows the last element in the stack (the top one). Firstly, checks  stack is empty or not. 
- If stack is empty, returns false.
- If stack is not empty, the last element is assigned to the item. After that, we can look the top one element.  If it is success, returns true.
